Hi,
Welcome to the IBNIZ chugin for ChucK!
Please visit original IBNIZ program website:
http://pelulamu.net/ibniz/

To know how to use IBNIZ please read: ibniz.txt

To know ibniz licence please read: ibniz_licence.txt

This is a temptative to integrate IBNIZ in a Chuck chugin, there is only sound and it probably doesn't work exaclty the same way as the original program.

For any help support or bug report:
julien.saintmartin@googlemail.com


To do list:
- Update VisualC++ project files: ibniz.dsw ibniz.dsp
